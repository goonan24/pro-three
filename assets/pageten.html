  <header>Using Cyber Tech Skill in the Army</header>
  <p>
      In the Army you will find that there is three distguished branchs that deal in 
      the field of Technology. These branches are Military Intelligence, Signal, and the Cyber Branch.
      All of these branches help the army and the country as a whole to help secure different areas in the Technology
      space. They all have thier specific areas that they work on but when you put them together they cover all of the necessary space.

  <sub-header>Military Intelligence</sub-header>
  <p> The Military Intelligence branch is the oldest of the three. It is the intelligence branch of the United States Army, who's main mission is to provide timely, relevant, accurate, and synchronized intelligence and 
    electronic warfare support to tactical, operational and strategic-level commanders. The Army's intelligence components produce intelligence both for 
    Army use and for sharing across the national intelligence community.</p>
  <sub-header>Signal</sub-header>
  <p>The United States Army Signal Corps (USASC) is a branch of the United States Army that creates and manages communications and 
    information systems for the command and control of combined arms forces. It was established in 1860, the brainchild of Major Albert J. Myer, 
    and had an important role in the American Civil War. Over its history, it had the initial responsibility for portfolios and new technologies 
    that were eventually transferred to other U.S. government entities. Such responsibilities included military intelligence, weather forecasting, and aviation.</p>
  <sub-header>CYBER</sub-header>
  <p>U.S. Army Cyber Command integrates and conducts cyberspace operations, electromagnetic warfare, and information operations, ensuring decision dominance 
    and freedom of action for friendly forces in and through the cyber domain and the information dimension, while denying the same to our adversaries.</p>
